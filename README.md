# Awesome React Libraries 🛠️ (WIP)

A collection of "my favourite" tools and libraries for the React ecosystem. these are the packages I would love to choose in any of my projects, have pretty good APIs, feature rich and (probably) better than other different libraries for the same feature/functionality.

## Data Table/ Grids

- [Tanstack table](https://tanstack.com/table/) - Powerful Headless UI for building powerful tables & datagrids, Framework Agnostic & Feature Rich.

> If you're using [MUI](https://mui.com/) or [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/) as your UI libraries, instead of building and adding everything from scratch, you can use [Material React Table](https://www.material-react-table.com/) / [Mantine React Table](https://www.mantine-react-table.com/) which is built by Tanstack Table core team member and uses components from the respective UI library.
